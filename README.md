# Introduction to Python

In this I will try to cover basics of python which is required for Data Science.

##  What is Python?
* Python is a very general purpose programming language, which means it has wide variety of applications. 
* It can be used in web development, Mobile Applications, Machine Learning, Data Mining etc.

##  Why Python?
* If you ask any person who knows python all of them will tell that its the easiest language to learn and code.
* You can code in python like writing steps in english or any language.
* Its very to easy to interpret.
* Line of codes require to run a program is less compare to other programming languages. This we can encounter below when we run our 1st program

### 1st Program in Python - [Hello World](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python/blob/master/Hello%20Word.ipynb "Hello World") 
#### Python is **[Case Sensitive](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python/blob/master/Case%20Sensitivity.ipynb "Case Sensitive")** means Print and print have different meaning in python. So If i write Z=1 and z=2 it will not overide the variables but store two different values in each.

## [Variables](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python/blob/master/Variables.ipynb)
* Variable is used to store values in python.
* Syntax : Variable_name = "Value". **=** is used an assignment operator.

* Variable names can consist of any characters or alphabets. They can have alphanumeric or special characters in them.
* Variable names cannot start with number or special characters except the **_** (Underscore).

> * Try to keep variables in plain and simple language so its easy to understand what values they represent.
> * Avoid using variables which are similar to the attributes or function in the in-built libraries.

## Operators
## Types of Operators in Python

* Arithmetic Operators (For Basic calculation Purpose)
    * '*' --> Multiplication
    * '/'--> Division
    * '+' --> Addition
    * '-'-- > Subtraction
    * '%' --> Modulous

![Arithmetic](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python-for-Data-Science/blob/master/Images/Arithmetic.JPG)
   
    
* Comparison Operator (For Comparing two variables and constants)
    * Less than '<'
	* greater than '>'
	* Equal to '=='
	* Less than or equal to '<='
	* Greater than or equal to '>='
	* Not equal to '!='

![Comparison](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python-for-Data-Science/blob/master/Images/Comparison.JPG)
    
* Logical Operator (Used for Logical conditions)
    * And
    * Or
    * Not
 
![Logical](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python-for-Data-Science/blob/master/Images/Logical.JPG)
  
* Bitwise Operator (Binary numbers operations)
    * Bitwise And '&'
    * Bitwise OR '|'
    * Bitwise XOR '^'
    * Bitwise Not '~'
    * Left shift '<<'
    * Right shift '>>'
    
* Identity Operator (For checking the identity of constants and variables)
    * is
    * is not

* Membership Operator (For finding relations between two variables)
    * in
    * not in
