# Introduction to Python

In this I will try to cover basics of python which is required for Data Science.

##  What is Python?
* Python is a very general purpose programming language, which means it has wide variety of applications. 
* It can be used in web development, Mobile Applications, Machine Learning, Data Mining etc.

##  Why Python?
* If you ask any person who knows python all of them will tell that its the easiest language to learn and code.
* You can code in python like writing steps in english or any language.
* Its very to easy to interpret.
* Line of codes require to run a program is less compare to other programming languages. This we can encounter below when we run our 1st program

### [Hello World](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python/blob/master/Hello%20Word.ipynb "Hello World")
Lets start the with the most common program. 

#### Python is **[Case Sensitive](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python/blob/master/Case%20Sensitivity.ipynb "Case Sensitive")** means Print and print have different meaning in python. So If i write Z=1 and z=2 it will not overide the variables but store two different values in each.

## [Variables](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Python/blob/master/Variables.ipynb)
* Variable is used to store values in python.
* Syntax : Variable_name = "Value". **=** is used an assignment operator.
* Variable names can consist of any characters or alphabets. They can have alphanumeric or special characters in them.
* Variable names cannot start with number or special characters except the **_** (Underscore).
> * Try to keep variables in plain and simple language so its easy to understand what values they represent.
> * Avoid using variables which are similar to the attributes or function in the in-built libraries.
